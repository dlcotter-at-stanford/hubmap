# Interactive colon map visualization

Use the filters on the left-hand sidebar to view a subset of samples taken from the colon displayed on the canvas.
The table below changes to show only the subset currently being viewed. Clicking on a sample will cause it to be
highlighted in yellow with red text in the table below.

### Next steps
* Retrieve sample data and colon from database rather than hardcoding
* Add layers for other types of information such as pathology
* Generate page dynamically using Flask
* Use a JavaScript framework to handle interaction and graphical tasks
