# to be constantly fluctuating in source commits.

# I had been using dev.cfg and prd.cfg to control whether the app ran in debug
# mode, but the app doesn't seem to pick up the values from there for some
# reason, so I've moved that part of the configuration into the run script. This
# also lets me control whether the app runs in the foreground (for debugging)
# or the background (for production).
